## 12. Known Issues and Resolutions

### Issues Found: 0

No critical issues identified during final validation.

### Warnings: 1 (Non-blocking)

**Warning:** Module 11 has limited NVIDIA platform mentions in theoretical content

**Assessment:** ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE

**Rationale:**
- Module 11 focuses on human-in-the-loop design patterns
- These patterns are largely framework-agnostic
- The lab implementation uses NVIDIA platforms
- Content appropriately emphasizes human oversight mechanisms

**Resolution:** No action required. Design is intentional and appropriate.
